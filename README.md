orion_constellation

This is the Graphing Cumulative Project for Codeacademy's Visualize Data with Python Skill Path. 

I used matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, and Python to create 2D and 3D plots of constellations. 

The first set of coordinates was for the Orion Constellation and the data was provided by Codeacademy.

The second set was for two stars in proximity to one another, Procyon and Sirius. 
I chose these stars and found the coordinates online. 

This project taught me a lot about graphing and visualizations using matplotlib in Python. 
I also learned how to use Jupyter Notebook.
